# Arduino

This repo is a collection of the code for the Arduino projects on https://www.tynkerhouse.io. The complete descriptions of the projects can be found at https://www.tynkerhouse.io/category/beginner/.

Through some simple exmaples, these projects demonstrate how to use an Arduio Mega 2560 board to read data from sensors and control actuators. The intended readers are entry-level kids and adults who are interested in circuits, micro-processors, embedded systems etc.

To use the code of a particular project, 
- Install Arduino IDE (Package available at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on your PC.
- Download the .ino file for the particular project from this repo.
- Build the breadboard circuit according to the instructions on https://www.tynkerhouse.io/category/beginner.
- Connect your PC with the Arduio Mega 2560 board with the USB cable coming with the board.
- Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE and start to play with it.

The projects are listed below (Updating continuously so be sure to check back)
- 8 LEDs
- 7-segment display
- Ultrasound sensor with LCD display
